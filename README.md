# Application-of-ML-based-Diabetes-Prediction-model

ABSTRACT
Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder affecting millions of people worldwide.
Early detection and accurate prediction of diabetes can play a crucial role in
decision making for handling and prevention of complications. This project aims
to develop a machine learning model for diabetes prediction that can accurately
predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on various clinical
features.
In this project dataset is collected, from healthcare databases, surveys, and medical
records, on considering the relevance patients having diabetes or not. Data
cleaning techniques are playing an important role in cleaning and normalize the
collected data, by removing any inconsistencies or missing values.
Next, feature extraction methods are utilized to identify the most significant
predictors of diabetes from the available dataset.
Machine learning algorithms are trained and evaluated to build the system.
